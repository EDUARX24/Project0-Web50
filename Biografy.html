        <h3>SEBASTIAN VETTEL</h3>
        <p>
          Sebastian Vettel was born on July 3, 1987 in Heppenheim, Germany. From
          a very young age, he showed great talent for motorsport and started
          racing karting at the age of 8. In the following years, Vettel
          excelled in various grassroots motorsport categories and in 2006 made
          his Formula 1 debut with the BMW Sauber team.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2007 Vettel joined the Toro Rosso team and in 2008 he took his
          first victory at the Italian Grand Prix, becoming the youngest driver
          to win a Formula 1 race. Vettel joined the Red Bull Racing team in
          2009 and started a highly successful partnership with the team. During
          his time with Red Bull, Vettel won four consecutive Formula 1
          championships, from 2010 to 2013, setting several records in the
          process.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2015, Vettel joined the Ferrari team, but failed to replicate his
          previous success. Despite this, he remained a respected driver and
          admired for his skill and positive attitude on and off the track. In
          2021, Vettel joined the Aston Martin team (previously known as Racing
          Point) and announced his retirement from Formula 1 at the end of the
          season. In his career, Vettel achieved 53 Formula 1 race victories and
          was highly respected for his skill and positive attitude. Off the
          track, he is passionate about music and plays various instruments.

Today I’m back in Spielberg, in beautiful Styria, where we built a bee hotel last year in the shape of a racing car together with children from the Frohnleiten primary school. Do you remember the event? Now we wanted to see who has moved into the hotel and whether it has been accepted by the bees and insects… And wooow!!! Not only has it been accepted, but it is “completely booked”! It looks like we will have to add a few more rooms to it!</p>
                    <h4 id="list-item-2">#RACE4WOMEN</h4>
                    <p> “Today I hosted a karting event with eight young women from the local area around Jeddah. It was really nice to meet these young ladies, who came from various different backgrounds, and had different levels of experience driving karts. They all impressed me and I was really inspired by their confidence and desire to get involved in this event. I hope they continue on this path of driving for pleasure and continue to enjoy these experiences. Maybe in the future they will be competing in serious competitions with great success. A big ‘thank you’ to The Track Jeddah for helping make today possible. It was a fun day, promoting the values that are important to me.” (Sebastian Vettel)</p>

                    <p>Sebastian Vettel’s focus on protecting the environment saw him lead a litter picking exercise following today’s British GP. “I think it is important that we all respect the environment and don’t rely on other people to clear up after us. We have to start somewhere and each one of us can make a difference now” said Sebastian.</p>
                    <h4 id="list-item-4">Water</h4>
                    <p>The world’s oceans are the habitat of a highly sensitive flora and fauna. This complex ecosystem, one of the most important bases of human life, is under threat. Therefore, one would think that we understand, value and protect our oceans. But rubbish and toxic wastewater still end up in the sea. The result of which is ecological disasters, such as here in the Sea of Marmara. We urgently need a change of mind, a joint effort to save our planet and thus humanity.</p>
